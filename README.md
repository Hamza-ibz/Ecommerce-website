<h1 align="center">Ecommerce Website</h1>
<p>Here is my ecommerce website in which electronic gadgets and product are being "sold". These products are dummy data stored in mongodb. Within the website it contains multiple pages both for the customer and staff. The website consists of Home, Products, Login, Basket, and Staff pages. The staff page also has its own pages, in which it allows the staff to carry out many functions such as login, view products, add products and edit products. For all webpages it has a navigation bar as well as a footer.</p>

- The front end is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Server-side scripts are written in PHP.
- Browser data (for example, for customer tracking and session management) is stored using HTML local/session storage.
- Persistent data (for example, customers’ details, orders, products, etc.) is stored on the server using MongoDB.
- AJAX is used for some of the communication between client and server. For example, AJAX used to keep the customer’s basket and stock information synchronized.
